        <h3>Where young mavericks build the future.</h3>
        <p>
            FR8 is a residency incubator for the next generation of Founders, launching in Espoo, Finland.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a place for serious builders — people who are ready to drop the distractions and go all-in on their ideas. You'll live and work full-time in a 650m² mansion alongside other ambitious bold thinkers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            FR8 isn't for everyone. We have high standards, and if you're not hitting them, you're out.
            <br>
            It's intense, fast-paced, and designed for people who want to push boundaries and make something that reshapes the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are a non-profit. We take 0% equity, no strings attached. And it's 100% free.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you're just starting to brainstorm, working on a project, or already in the early stages of building your startup, you're eligible to apply. Solo applicants are welcome, but having a team is a plus.
